# Algorithm Visualizations

A Next.js 14 project for visualizing famous algorithms using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project includes visualizations for various algorithms such as unique path finding, N-Queens problem, tree or graph traversals, and more.

## Features

- **Unique Path Finding**: Visualize algorithms to find the number of unique paths in a grid and solve the number of islands problem.
- **N-Queens Problem**: Interactive visualization of the N-Queens problem, demonstrating various solutions and techniques.
- **Tree and Graph Traversals**: Visualize traversal algorithms including depth-first search (DFS) with in-order, pre-order, and post-order techniques, as well as breadth-first search (BFS).
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Visualize five sorting algorithms, including merge sort, quick sort, heap sort (with a tree graph visualization), selection sort, and bubble sort.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS, providing a user-friendly interface for exploring algorithms.
